Airflow-Salesforce Hooks and Operators

Provides a simple hook and operators to migrate your Salesforce data to another database.

This can be useful when all of your data is already stored in a warehouse seperate from Salesforce and all of your data analytics/visualization tools are also tied to a different warehouse.
